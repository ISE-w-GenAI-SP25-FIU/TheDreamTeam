User was easily able to navigate to the workouts page. Once on the page, they attempted to find a workout using the search bar. User noted that it would be nice to have workouts showing as soon as the page loads. User was hesitant to use the Filter button and opted for the search bar for the majority of the task.

Results:

Following the feedback from the usability testing, a few small but distinct changes were made to the design of the workouts page based on the user’s comments. First, one user noted that the search bar “was confusing to know what to type”. To clear up any uncertainty, a list of workouts will be populated upon loading the workouts page so the user understands the format of the list and the keywords they should use. Additionally, another user noted that they were “confused by what Filter meant” in the dropdown. To relieve some of the confusion, we opted to change the text to “Sort By”. Lastly, a user suggested that “it would be nice to favorite certain workouts so I don’t have to search every time”. Based on this feature request, a favorite button (star icon) was added to the top right of the workouts page. When clicked, a list of the user's favorite workouts will be shown. To favorite a workout, the user must click the favorite button (star symbol) in the list of workouts.
